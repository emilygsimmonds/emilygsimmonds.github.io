I am a quantitative ecologist with an interest in understanding how biological systems are influenced by their environment. My work looks at forecasting how individuals and populations respond to weather and climatic changes. My approach focuses on methodological innovation and refinement, alongside ecological insight. I have a particular interest in improving how we quantify and communicate uncertainty.

**Currently, I am exploring patterns and drivers of ecological predictability as a Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Edinburgh.**
